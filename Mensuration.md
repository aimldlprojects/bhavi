## Mensuration

### **Formulas for Perimeter and Area**

#### **1. Square**
- **Perimeter**: \( P = 4 \times \text{side} \)
- **Area**: \( A = \text{side}^2 \)

#### **2. Rectangle**
- **Perimeter**: \( P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{breadth}) \)
- **Area**: \( A = \text{length} \times \text{breadth} \)

#### **3. Triangle**
- **Perimeter**: \( P = \text{sum of all three sides} \)
- **Area**: \( A = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \)

#### **4. Equilateral Triangle**
- **Perimeter**: \( P = 3 \times \text{side} \)
- **Area**: \( A = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} \times \text{side}^2 \)

#### **5. Polygon (Regular with \( n \) sides)**
- **Perimeter**: \( P = n \times \text{side length} \)
- **Area**: \( A = \frac{1}{4} \times n \times \text{side length}^2 \times \cot\left(\frac{\pi}{n}\right) \)

#### **6. Hexagon (Regular)**
- **Perimeter**: \( P = 6 \times \text{side} \)
- **Area**: \( A = \frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2} \times \text{side}^2 \)
